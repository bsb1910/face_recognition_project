# Face_recognition_project

PyPower Face Recognition is a Python-based face recognition system that identifies people from images and videos using deep learning–based facial embeddings. The project uses a pre-trained OpenFace model to extract unique face features and a machine learning classifier to recognize known individuals accurately.

The workflow includes face detection, embedding extraction, model training, and real-time or image-based face recognition. This project demonstrates practical applications of computer vision, deep learning, and machine learning using Python and OpenCV.
